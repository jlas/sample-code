# Candies

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/candies

Alice is a kindergarden teacher. She wants to give some candies to the
children in her class.  All the children sit in a line (their positions
are fixed), and each of them has a rating score according to his or her
performance in the class. Alice wants to give at least 1 candy to each
child. If two children sit next to each other, then the one with the
higher rating must get more candies. Alice wants to save money, so she
needs to minimize the total number of candies given to the children.

## Input format:

Alice's class. Each of the following N lines contains an integer that
indicates the rating of each child.
