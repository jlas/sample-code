# Bigger is Greater

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bigger-is-greater

Given a word w, rearrange the letters of w to construct another word s in
such a way that s is lexicographically greater than w. In case of multiple
possible answers, find the lexicographically smallest one among them.

## Input format:

The first line of input contains t, the number of test cases. Each of the
next t lines contains w.

## Output format:

For each testcase, output a string lexicographically bigger than w in a
separate line. In case of multiple possible answers, print the
lexicographically smallest one, and if no answer exists, print no answer.

## Sample input:

    5
    ab
    bb
    hefg
    dhck
    dkhc

## Sample output:

    ba
    no answer
    hegf
    dhkc
    hcdk
