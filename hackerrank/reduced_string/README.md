# Reduced String

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/reduced-string

Shil has a string, S, consisting of N lowercase English letters. In one
operation, he can delete any pair of adjacent letters with same value.
For example, string "aabcc" would become either "aab" or "bcc" after 1
operation.

Shil wants to reduce S as much as possible. To do this, he will repeat
the above operation as many times as it can be performed. Help Shil out
by finding and printing S's non-reducible form!

Note: If the final string is empty, print Empty String.

## Input format:

A single string, S

## Output format:

If the final string is empty, print Empty String; otherwise, print the final
non-reducible string.

## Sample input

    aaabccddd

## Sample output

    abd
